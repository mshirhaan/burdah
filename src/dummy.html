<p>
  And I regarded the advice of the signs of old age as blame, the advice of grey
  hair as a lie.
</p>
<p>Whereas these signs are above suspicion in their advice.</p>

<h3 class="tafseer-heading">Commentary</h3>
<p>
  Old age, grey or white hair are advisors. They cry out that death is near.
  Repent from your sins before death takes you. But one does not listen to this
  advice.
</p>
<p>
  Imam Busiri عليهالرمحةsays that my old age is crying out to me but I do not
  listen. What effect can your advice have on me o advisors when I do not even
  pay any attention to the advice of my old age. Go and advise someone else.
</p>

<p>
  Once when Sayyiduna Bayazid Bustami عليهالرمحةsaw himself in the mirror, he
  noticed white hairs in his blessed beard. He began to weep and said old age
  has become apparent but I have not gathered any good deeds for the hereafter.
</p>

<p>
  Sayyiduna Umar رضياهللعنه asked a neighbour to stand outside his house daily
  and shout out “O Umar, do not forget death, and do continue good deeds."
</p>
<p>
  When Sayyiduna Umar رضياهللعنه noticed a white hair in his blessed beard he
  told the neighbour to stop calling in the mornings. He said, “My caller, my
  reminder is in front of my eyes, there is no longer any need for you to remind
  me.”
